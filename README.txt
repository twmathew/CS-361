Live website link: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~olareyp/CS361/index.php
The concept of the website is to allow a user to locate their pet.
First page: Login: select a profile, or make a new one.
Second page: Lists the "pet(s)" of that user, stored in a database. Can add or remove pets here
Third Page (from clicking "Find 'petname' "): put in some fixed values for MAC address and cell phone tower to "locate" pet.
